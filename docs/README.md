# Project Documentation

This directory contains the living documentation for the project. Start here, then dive into specific areas.

## Start Here

- `../README.md`: quick project overview and how to run the generator

## Core Guides

- `tournament-generation.md`: purpose, architecture, flow, and extension points for the generation pipeline
- `architecture.md`: system boundaries and current layering
- `commands-and-queries.md`: CQRS flows, buses, and extension examples for commands/queries
- `development.md`: local development setup and quality checks

UI notes and workflows live in `development.md` for now. A dedicated UI guide can be added once the interface grows.

## How to Extend the Docs

- Add new documents for major subsystems (persistence, UI, exports)
- Keep documents focused and link back here for discoverability
